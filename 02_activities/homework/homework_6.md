**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Through my work in the operational risk and control in the financial institution, I have focused on identifying and mitigating risks associated with financial products and services.  It is important to integrate ethics and equity into these processes to prevent financial and reputational risks. 

In my previous projects, data privacy would be one of the key ethical concerns. (1) Accuracy of the risk models:  In the risk and control assessments, especially in the fraud detection model, it must avoid bias and ensure fairness across customer demographics. This will reduce the likelihood of unfair treatment and discriminatory outcomes in the banking decisions. (2) Ethical use of customer data: Customer data should be anonymized in risk assessments to protect privacy. Moreover, informed consent must be obtained from the customers when collecting and using personal information.

Equity is another critical component that demands attention in our risk and control models. I have observed that loan approval algorithms often perpetuate historical biases. For example, the location of a home can significantly impact loan approval rates. In Toronto, areas that are considered to have "bad" locations might include those with higher crime rates, lower property values, or economic challenges. Loan applications for these areas usually have higher decline rate. We must develop inclusive risk framework to ensure all customers have fair access to financial resources. 

Ongoing monitoring for ethics and equity is critical within the banking systems. By prioritizing transparency and fair treatment for all customers, we can mitigate risks associated with bias and unethical practices.
